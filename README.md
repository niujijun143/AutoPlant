# Hydroponic Team â€“ AutoPlant ðŸŒ±

An interdisciplinary project at Virginia Tech IDPro.

Hydroponics replaces soil with nutrient-rich water, saving resources but often requiring frequent manual monitoring. Our project automates this process with sensors, feedback control, and cloud connectivity.

## Features

- Automated monitoring of pH, TDS, and water levels

- Integrated Arduino system controlling pumps via relays

- Real-time data display on LCD

- Cloud upload for remote monitoring

## Sensors

Water Level Sensor â€“ tracks reservoir water level

pH Sensor â€“ monitors acidity/alkalinity of the solution

TDS Sensor â€“ measures nutrient concentration

## Tech Stack

Arduino for control and data processing

Relays for pump control

LCD Display for local feedback

Cloud Integration for remote access

## Acknowledgment

Developed as part of Virginia Tech IDPro â€“ AutoPlant Project.
